/*
 * Under at least some conditions, output from NSLog has been unavailable in the RNBranch module.
 * Hence that module uses the RCTLog macros from <React/RCTLog.h>. The React logger is nicer than
 * NSLog anyway, since it provides log levels with runtime filtering, file and line context and
 * an identifier for the thread that logged the message.
 *
 * This wrapper lets you use functions with the same name in Swift. For example:
 *
 * RCTLogInfo("application launched")
 *
 * generates
 *
 * 2017-04-06 12:31:09.611 [info][tid:main][AppDelegate.swift:18] application launched
 *
 * This is currently part of this sample app. There may be some issues integrating it into an
 * Objective-C library, either react-native-branch or react-native itself, but it may find its
 * way into one or the other eventually. Feel free to reuse it as desired.
