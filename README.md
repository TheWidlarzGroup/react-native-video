## Installation

Using npm:

```shell
npm install --save react-native-video
```

or using yarn:

```shell
yarn add react-native-video
```

<details>
  <summary>iOS</summary>

Run `react-native link` to link the react-native-video library.

If you would like to allow other apps to play music over your video component, add:

**AppDelegate.m**

```objective-c
#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>  // import

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ...
  [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient error:nil];  // allow
  ...
}
```
Note: you can also use the `ignoreSilentSwitch` prop, shown below.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tvOS</summary>
  
Run `react-native link` to link the react-native-video library.

`react-native link` don’t works properly with the tvOS target so we need to add the library manually.

First select your project in Xcode.

<img src="./docs/tvOS-step-1.jpg" width="40%">

After that, select the tvOS target of your application and select « General » tab

<img src="./docs/tvOS-step-2.jpg" width="40%">

Scroll to « Linked Frameworks and Libraries » and tap on the + button

<img src="./docs/tvOS-step-3.jpg" width="40%">

Select RCTVideo-tvOS

<img src="./docs/tvOS-step-4.jpg" width="40%">
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Android</summary>

Run `react-native link` to link the react-native-video library.

Or if you have trouble, make the following additions to the given files manually:

**android/settings.gradle**

The newer ExoPlayer library will work for most people.

```gradle
include ':react-native-video'
project(':react-native-video').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-video/android-exoplayer')
```

If you need to use the old Android MediaPlayer based player, use the following instead:

```gradle
include ':react-native-video'
project(':react-native-video').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-video/android')
```


**android/app/build.gradle**

```gradle
dependencies {
   ...
   compile project(':react-native-video')
}
```

**MainApplication.java**

On top, where imports are:

```java
import com.brentvatne.react.ReactVideoPackage;
```

Add the `ReactVideoPackage` class to your list of exported packages.

```java
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            new ReactVideoPackage()
    );
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

Make the following additions to the given files manually:

**windows/myapp.sln**

Add the `ReactNativeVideo` project to your solution.

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2015
2. Right-click Solution icon in Solution Explorer > Add > Existing Project
  * UWP: Select `node_modules\react-native-video\windows\ReactNativeVideo\ReactNativeVideo.csproj`
  * WPF: Select `node_modules\react-native-video\windows\ReactNativeVideo.Net46\ReactNativeVideo.Net46.csproj`

**windows/myapp/myapp.csproj**

Add a reference to `ReactNativeVideo` to your main application project. From Visual Studio 2015:

1. Right-click main application project > Add > Reference...
  * UWP: Check `ReactNativeVideo` from Solution Projects.
  * WPF: Check `ReactNativeVideo.Net46` from Solution Projects.

**MainPage.cs**

Add the `ReactVideoPackage` class to your list of exported packages.
```cs
using ReactNative;
using ReactNative.Modules.Core;
using ReactNative.Shell;
using ReactNativeVideo; // <-- Add this
using System.Collections.Generic;
...

        public override List<IReactPackage> Packages
        {
            get
            {
                return new List<IReactPackage>
                {
                    new MainReactPackage(),
                    new ReactVideoPackage(), // <-- Add this
                };
            }
        }

...
```

<br>Value: string with a URL for the poster, e.g. "https://baconmockup.com/300/200/"

Platforms: all

#### posterResizeMode
Determines how to resize the poster image when the frame doesn't match the raw video dimensions.
* **"contain" (default)** - Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
* **"center"** - Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.
* **"cover"** - Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
* **"none"** - Don't apply resize
* **"repeat"** - Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The image will keep its size and aspect ratio. (iOS only)
* **"stretch"** - Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

Platforms: all

#### progressUpdateInterval
Delay in milliseconds between onProgress events in milliseconds.

Default: 250.0

Platforms: all

### rate
Speed at which the media should play. 
* **0.0** - Pauses the video
* **1.0** - Play at normal speed
* **Other values** - Slow down or speed up playback

Platforms: all

Note: For Android MediaPlayer, rate is only supported on Android 6.0 and higher devices.

* **"stretch"** - Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS, Windows UWP

#### selectedTextTrack
Configure which text track (caption or subtitle), if any, is shown.

```
selectedTextTrack={{
  type: Type,
  value: Value
}}
```

Example:
```
selectedTextTrack={{
  type: "title",
  value: "English Subtitles"
}}
```

Type | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
"system" (default) | N/A | Display captions only if the system preference for captions is enabled
"disabled" | N/A | Don't display a text track
"title" | string | Display the text track with the title specified as the Value, e.g. "French 1"
"language" | string | Display the text track with the language specified as the Value, e.g. "fr"
"index" | number | Display the text track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0

Both iOS & Android (only 4.4 and higher) offer Settings to enable Captions for hearing impaired people. If "system" is selected and the Captions Setting is enabled, iOS/Android will look for a caption that matches that customer's language and display it. 

If a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, no text track will be displayed. If multiple tracks match the criteria, the first match will be used.

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer, iOS

#### stereoPan
Adjust the balance of the left and right audio channels.  Any value between –1.0 and 1.0 is accepted.
* **-1.0** - Full left
* **0.0 (default)** - Center
* **1.0** - Full right

Platforms: Android MediaPlayer

#### textTracks
Load one or more "sidecar" text tracks. This takes an array of objects representing each track. Each object should have the format:

Property | Description
--- | ---
title | Descriptive name for the track
language | 2 letter [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) representing the language
type | Mime type of the track<br> * TextTrackType.SRT - .srt SubRip Subtitle<br> * TextTrackType.TTML - .ttml TTML<br> * TextTrackType.VTT - .vtt WebVTT
uri | URL for the text track. Currently, only tracks hosted on a webserver are supported

Example:
```
import { TextTrackType }, Video from 'react-native-video';

textTracks={[
  {
    title: "English CC",
    language: "en",
    type: "text/vtt", TextTrackType.VTT,
    uri: "https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/subtitles/subtitles_en.vtt"
  },
  {
    title: "Spanish Subtitles",
    language: "es",
    type: "application/x-subrip", TextTrackType.SRT,
    uri: "https://durian.blender.org/wp-content/content/subtitles/sintel_es.srt"
  }
]}
```

This isn't support on iOS because AVPlayer doesn't support it. Text tracks must be loaded as part of an HLS playlist.

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer

#### useTextureView
Output to a TextureView instead of the default SurfaceView. In general, you will want to use SurfaceView because it is more efficient and provides better performance. However, SurfaceViews has two limitations:
* It can't be animated, transformed or scaled
* You can't overlay multiple SurfaceViews

useTextureView can only be set at same time you're setting the source.

* **false (default)** - Use a SurfaceView
* **true** - Use a TextureView

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer

#### volume
Adjust the volume.
* **1.0 (default)** - Play at full volume
* **0.0** - Mute the audio
* **Other values** - Reduce volume

Platforms: all

### Event props

#### onLoad
Callback function that is called when the media is loaded and ready to play.

Payload:

Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
currentPosition | number | Time in seconds where the media will start
duration | number | Length of the media in seconds
naturalSize | object | Properties:<br> * width - Width in pixels that the video was encoded at<br> * height - Height in pixels that the video was encoded at<br> * orientation - "portrait" or "landscape"
textTracks | array | An array of text track info objects with the following properties:<br> * index - Index number<br> * title - Description of the track<br> * language - 2 letter [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code<br> * type - Mime type of track

Example:
```
{ 
  canPlaySlowForward: true,
  canPlayReverse: false,
  canPlaySlowReverse: false,
  canPlayFastForward: false,
  canStepForward: false,
  canStepBackward: false,
  currentTime: 0,
  duration: 5910.208984375,
  naturalSize: {
     height: 1080
     orientation: 'landscape'
     width: '1920'
  },
  textTracks: [
    { title: '#1 French', language: 'fr', index: 0, type: 'text/vtt' },
    { title: '#2 English CC', language: 'en', index: 1, type: 'text/vtt' },
    { title: '#3 English Director Commentary', language: 'en', index: 2, type: 'text/vtt' }
  ]
}
```

Platforms: all

#### onLoadStart
Callback function that is called when the media starts loading.

Payload:

Property | Description
--- | ---
isNetwork | Boolean indicating if the media is being loaded from the network
type | Type of the media. Not available on Windows
uri | URI for the media source. Not available on Windows

Example:
```
{
  isNetwork: true,
  type: '',
  uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8'
}
```

Platforms: all

### Methods
Methods operate on a ref to the Video element. You can create a ref using code like:
```
return (
  <Video source={...}
    ref => (this.player = ref) />
);
```

#### seek()
`seek(seconds)`

Seek to the specified position represented by seconds. seconds is a float value.

`seek()` can only be called after the `onLoad` event has fired.

Example:
```
this.player.seek(200); // Seek to 3 minutes, 20 seconds
```

Platforms: all

##### Exact seek

By default iOS seeks within 100 milliseconds of the target position. If you need more accuracy, you can use the seek with tolerance method:

`seek(seconds, tolerance)`

tolerance is the max distance in milliseconds from the seconds position that's allowed. Using a more exact tolerance can cause seeks to take longer. If you want to seek exactly, set tolerance to 0.

Example:
```
this.player.seek(120, 50); // Seek to 2 minutes with +/- 50 milliseconds accuracy
```

Platforms: iOS


### Additional props

To see the full list of available props, you can check the [propTypes](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video/blob/master/Video.js#L246) of the Video.js component.

- By default, iOS 9+ will only load encrypted HTTPS urls. If you need to load content from a webserver that only supports HTTP, you will need to modify your Info.plist file and add the following entry:

<img src="./docs/AppTransportSecuritySetting.png" width="50%">

For more detailed info check this [article](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-add-app-transport-security-exception-domains)
</details>

### Android Expansion File Usage
Within your render function, assuming you have a file called
"background.mp4" in your expansion file. Just add your main and (if applicable) patch version
```
<Video
  source={{uri: "background", mainVer: 1, patchVer: 0}}
/>
```
This will look for an .mp4 file (background.mp4) in the given expansion version.

### Load files with the RN Asset System

The asset system [introduced in RN `0.14`](http://www.reactnative.com/react-native-v0-14-0-released/) allows loading image resources shared across iOS and Android without touching native code. As of RN `0.31` [the same is true](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/91ff6868a554c4930fd5fda6ba8044dbd56c8374) of mp4 video assets for Android. As of [RN `0.33`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.33.0) iOS is also supported. Requires `react-native-video@0.9.0`.

```
<Video
  source={require('../assets/video/turntable.mp4')}
/>
```

### Play in background on iOS

To enable audio to play in background on iOS the audio session needs to be set to `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback`. See [Apple documentation][3] for additional details. (NOTE: there is now a ticket to [expose this as a prop]( https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video/issues/310) )

## Examples

- See an [Example integration][1] in `react-native-login` *note that this example uses an older version of this library, before we used `export default` -- if you use `require` you will need to do `require('react-native-video').default` as per instructions above.*
- Try the included [VideoPlayer example][2] yourself:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:react-native-community/react-native-video.git
   cd react-native-video/example
   npm install
   open ios/VideoPlayer.xcodeproj

   ```

   Then `Cmd+R` to start the React Packager, build and run the project in the simulator.

- [Lumpen Radio](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpen-radio) contains another example integration using local files and full screen background video.

## Updating

### Version 3.0

#### All platforms now auto-play
Previously, on Android ExoPlayer if the paused prop was not set, the media would not automatically start playing. The only way it would work was if you set `paused={false}`. This has been changed to automatically play if paused is not set so that the behavior is consistent across platforms.

#### All platforms now keep their paused state when returning from the background
Previously, on Android MediaPlayer if you setup an AppState event when the app went into the background and set a paused prop so that when you returned to the app the video would be paused it would be ignored.

Note, Windows does not have a concept of an app going into the background, so this doesn't apply there.

#### Use Android SDK 27 by default
Version 3.0 updates the Android build tools and SDK to version 27. React Native is in the process of [switchting over](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18095#issuecomment-395596130) to SDK 27 in preparation for Google's requirement that new Android apps [use SDK 26](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html) by August 2018.

You will either need to install the version 27 SDK and version 27.0.3 buildtools or modify your build.gradle file to configure react-native-video to use the same build settings as the rest of your app as described below.

##### Using app build settings
You will need to create a `project.ext` section in the top-level build.gradle file (not app/build.gradle). Fill in the values from the example below using the values found in your app/build.gradle file.
```
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    ... // Various other settings go here
}

allprojects {
    ... // Various other settings go here

    project.ext {
        compileSdkVersion = 23
        buildToolsVersion = "23.0.1"

        minSdkVersion = 16
        targetSdkVersion = 22
    }
}
```

## TODOS

- [ ] Add support for playing multiple videos in a sequence (will interfere with current `repeat` implementation)
- [x] Callback to get buffering progress for remote videos
- [ ] Bring API closer to HTML5 `<Video>` [reference](http://devdocs.io/html/element/video)
