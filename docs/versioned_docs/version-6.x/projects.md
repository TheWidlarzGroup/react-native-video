# Useful Projects

This page lists open-source projects that can be helpful for your player implementation. <br/>
If you have a project that could benefit other users, feel free to open a PR to add it here.

## Our (TheWidlarzGroup) Libraries
- [react-native-video-player](https://github.com/TheWidlarzGroup/react-native-video-player): Our video player UI library.
- [Offline Video SDK](https://www.thewidlarzgroup.com/offline-video-sdk?utm_source=rnv&utm_medium=docs&utm_id=projects_offline-video-sdk): If you're building an app that needs **offline playback** (e.g., downloading HLS videos, subtitles, audio tracks, or DRM-protected content), check out our commercial Offline Video SDK. It integrates with `react-native-video` and is available with a [free trial](https://sdk.thewidlarzgroup.com/signup?utm_source=rnv&utm_medium=docs&utm_id=projects_start-trial-offline-video-sdk). To get started quickly, you can clone our [Offline Video Starter Project](https://github.com/TheWidlarzGroup/react-native-offline-video-starter?utm_source=rnv&utm_medium=docs&utm_id=projects_offline-video-starter), which includes a ready-to-run example app demonstrating offline playback, multi-audio, subtitles, and DRM setup.
