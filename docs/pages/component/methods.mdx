# Methods

This page shows the list of available methods

### `dismissFullscreenPlayer`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`dismissFullscreenPlayer(): Promise<void>`

Take the player out of fullscreen mode.

> [!WARNING]
> deprecated, use setFullScreen method instead

### `pause`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`pause(): Promise<void>`

Pause the video.

### `presentFullscreenPlayer`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`presentFullscreenPlayer(): Promise<void>`

Put the player in fullscreen mode.

On iOS, this displays the video in a fullscreen view controller with controls.

On Android, this puts the navigation controls in fullscreen mode. It is not a complete fullscreen implementation, so you will still need to apply a style that makes the width and height match your screen dimensions to get a fullscreen video.

> [!WARNING]
> deprecated, use setFullScreen method instead

### `resume`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`resume(): Promise<void>`

Resume the video.

### `restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted`

<PlatformsList types={['iOS']} />

`restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted(restored)`

This function corresponds to the completion handler in Apple's [restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avpictureinpicturecontrollerdelegate/1614703-pictureinpicturecontroller?language=objc). IMPORTANT: This function must be called after `onRestoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop` is called.

### `save`

<PlatformsList types={['iOS']} />

`save(): Promise<{ uri: string }>`

Save video to your Photos with current filter prop. Returns promise.

Notes:

- Currently only supports highest quality export
- Currently only supports MP4 export
- Currently only supports exporting to user's cache directory with a generated UUID filename.
- User will need to remove the saved video through their Photos app
- Works with cached videos as well. (Checkout video-caching example)
- If the video is has not began buffering (e.g. there is no internet connection) then the save function will throw an error.
- If the video is buffering then the save function promise will return after the video has finished buffering and processing.

Future:

- Will support multiple qualities through options
- Will support more formats in the future through options
- Will support custom directory and file name through options

### `enterPictureInPicture`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

`enterPictureInPicture()`

To use this feature on Android with Expo, you must set 'enableAndroidPictureInPicture' true within expo plugin config (app.json)

```json
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-video",
      {
        "enableAndroidPictureInPicture": true,
      }
    ]
  ]
```

To use this feature on Android with Bare React Native, you must:

- [Declare PiP support](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture#declaring) in your AndroidManifest.xml
- setting `android:supportsPictureInPicture` to `true`

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  ...
  android:supportsPictureInPicture="true">
```

NOTE: Foreground picture in picture is not supported on Android due to limitations of react native (Single Activity App). So, If you call `enterPictureInPicture`, application will switch to background on Android.
NOTE: Video ads cannot start when you are using the PIP on iOS (more info available at [Google IMA SDK Docs](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/client-side/picture_in_picture?hl=en#starting_ads)). If you are using custom controls, you must hide your PIP button when you receive the `STARTED` event from `onReceiveAdEvent` and show it again when you receive the `ALL_ADS_COMPLETED` event.

### `exitPictureInPicture`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

`exitPictureInPicture()`

Exits the active picture in picture; if it is not active, the function call is ignored.

### `restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted`

<PlatformsList types={['iOS']} />

`restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted(restored)`

This function corresponds to the completion handler in Apple's [restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avpictureinpicturecontrollerdelegate/1614703-pictureinpicturecontroller?language=objc). IMPORTANT: This function must be called after `onRestoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop` is called.

### `seek`

<PlatformsList types={['All']} />

`seek(seconds)`

Seek to the specified position represented by seconds. seconds is a float value.

`seek()` can only be called after the `onLoad` event has fired. Once completed, the [onSeek](./events#onseek) event will be called.

#### Exact seek

<PlatformsList types={['iOS']} />

By default iOS seeks within 100 milliseconds of the target position. If you need more accuracy, you can use the seek with tolerance method:

`seek(seconds, tolerance)`

tolerance is the max distance in milliseconds from the seconds position that's allowed. Using a more exact tolerance can cause seeks to take longer. If you want to seek exactly, set tolerance to 0.

### `setVolume`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`setVolume(value): Promise<void>`

This function will change the volume exactly like [volume](./props#volume) property. default value and range are the same then.

### `getCurrentPosition`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`getCurrentPosition(): Promise<number>`

This function retrieves and returns the precise current position of the video playback, measured in seconds.
This function will throw an error if player is not initialized.


### `setSource`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

`setSource(source: ReactVideoSource): Promise<void>`

This function will change the source exactly like [source](./props#source) property.
Changing source with this function will overide source provided as props. 

### `setFullScreen`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'web']} />

`setFullScreen(fullscreen): Promise<void>`

If you set it to `true`, the player enters fullscreen mode. If you set it to `false`, the player exits fullscreen mode.

On iOS, this displays the video in a fullscreen view controller with controls.

On Android, this puts the navigation controls in fullscreen mode. It is not a complete fullscreen implementation, so you will still need to apply a style that makes the width and height match your screen dimensions to get a fullscreen video.

### `nativeHtmlVideoRef`

<PlatformsList types={['web']} />

A ref to the underlying html video element. This can be used if you need to integrate a 3d party, web only video library (like hls.js, shaka, video.js...).


### Example Usage

```tsx
const videoRef = useRef<VideoRef>(null);

const someCoolFunctions = async () => {
  if (!videoRef.current) {
    return;
  }

  // present or dismiss fullscreen player
  videoRef.current.presentFullscreenPlayer();
  videoRef.current.dismissFullscreenPlayer();

  // pause or resume the video
  videoRef.current.pause();
  videoRef.current.resume();

  // save video to your Photos with current filter prop
  const response = await videoRef.current.save();
  const path = response.uri;

  // seek to the specified position represented by seconds
  videoRef.current.seek(200);
  // or on iOS you can seek with tolerance
  videoRef.current.seek(200, 10);
};

return (
  <Video
    ref={videoRef}
    source={{uri: 'https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4'}}
  />
);
```

## Static methods

### `getWidevineLevel`

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Indicates whether the widevine level supported by device.

Possible values are:

- 0 - unable to determine widevine support (typically not supported)
- 1, 2, 3 - Widevine level supported

### `isCodecSupported`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'web']} />

Indicates whether the provided codec is supported level supported by device.

parameters:

- `mimetype`: mime type of codec to query
- `width`, `height`: resolution to query

Possible results:

- `hardware` - codec is supported by hardware
- `software` - codec is supported by software only
- `unsupported` - codec is not supported

### `isHEVCSupported`

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Helper which Indicates whether the provided HEVC/1920\*1080 is supported level supported by device. It uses isCodecSupported internally.

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { VideoDecoderProperties } from 'react-native-video';

VideoDecoderProperties.getWidevineLevel().then((level) => {
  ...
});

VideoDecoderProperties.isCodecSupported('video/hevc', 1920, 1080).then((support) => {
  ...
});

VideoDecoderProperties.isHEVCSupported().then((support) => {
  ...
});
```
