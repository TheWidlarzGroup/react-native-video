For android, more informations about live configuration can be find [here](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer/live-streaming?hl=en)

Example with default values:

```javascript
bufferConfig={{
  minBufferMs: 15000,
  maxBufferMs: 50000,

  backBufferDurationMs: 120000,
  cacheSizeMB: 0,
  live: {
      targetOffsetMs: 500,
  },
}}
```

Please note that the Android cache is a global cache that is shared among all components; individual components can still opt out of caching behavior by setting cacheSizeMB to 0, but multiple components with a positive cacheSizeMB will be sharing the same one, and the cache size will always be the first value set; it will not change during the app's lifecycle.

| "language"         | string | Play the audio track with the language specified as the Value, e.g. "fr"                    |
| "index"            | number | Play the audio track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0                          |

If a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, the first audio track will be played. If multiple tracks match the criteria, the first match will be used.

### `selectedTextTrack`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'visionOS']} />

Configure which text track (caption or subtitle), if any, is shown.

```javascript
selectedTextTrack={{
  type: Type,
  value: Value
}}
```

Example:

```javascript
selectedTextTrack={{
  type: "title",
  value: "English Subtitles"
}}
```

| Type               | Value  | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "system" (default) | N/A    | Display captions only if the system preference for captions is enabled        |
| "disabled"         | N/A    | Don't display a text track                                                    |
| "title"            | string | Display the text track with the title specified as the Value, e.g. "French 1" |
| "language"         | string | Display the text track with the language specified as the Value, e.g. "fr"    |
| "index"            | number | Display the text track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0          |

Both iOS & Android (only 4.4 and higher) offer Settings to enable Captions for hearing impaired people. If "system" is selected and the Captions Setting is enabled, iOS/Android will look for a caption that matches that customer's language and display it.

If a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, no text track will be displayed. If multiple tracks match the criteria, the first match will be used.

### `selectedVideoTrack`

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Configure which video track should be played. By default, the player uses Adaptive Bitrate Streaming to automatically select the stream it thinks will perform best based on available bandwidth.

```javascript
selectedVideoTrack={{
  type: Type,
  value: Value
}}
```

Example:

```javascript
selectedVideoTrack={{
  type: "resolution",
  value: 480
}}
```

| Type             | Value  | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "auto" (default) | N/A    | Let the player determine which track to play using ABR                       |
| "disabled"       | N/A    | Turn off video                                                               |
| "resolution"     | number | Play the video track with the height specified, e.g. 480 for the 480p stream |
| "index"          | number | Play the video track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0           |

If a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, ABR will be used.

### `shutterColor`

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Apply color to shutter view, if you see black flashes before video start then set

```javascript
shutterColor = 'transparent';
```

- black (default)

### `source`

Sets the media source. You can pass an asset loaded via require or an object with a uri.

Setting the source will trigger the player to attempt to load the provided media with all other given props. Please be sure that all props are provided before/at the same time as setting the source.

Rendering the player component with a null source will init the player, and start playing once a source value is provided.

Providing a null source value after loading a previous source will stop playback, and clear out the previous source content.

The docs for this prop are incomplete and will be updated as each option is investigated and tested.

#### Asset loaded via require

> ⚠️ on iOS, you file name must not contain spaces eg. `my video.mp4` will not work, use `my-video.mp4` instead

Example:

Pass directly the asset to play (deprecated)

```javascript
const sintel = require('./sintel.mp4');
source = {sintel};
```

Or by using an uri (starting from 6.0.0-beta.6)

```javascript
const sintel = require('./sintel.mp4');
source={{ uri: sintel }}
```

#### URI string

A number of URI schemes are supported by passing an object with a `uri` attribute.

All uri string shall be url encoded.
For exemple 'www.myurl.com/blabla?q=test uri' is invalid, where 'www.myurl.com/blabla?q=test%20uri' is valid

##### Web address (http://, https://)

<PlatformsList types={['All']} />

Example:

```javascript
source={{uri: 'https://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_10mb.mp4' }}
```

##### File path (file://)

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Example:

```javascript
source={{ uri: 'file:///sdcard/Movies/sintel.mp4' }}
```

Note: Your app will need to request permission to read external storage if you're accessing a file outside your app.

##### File from asset folder (asset://)

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Allows to play a video file from the asset folder from the application

Example:

```javascript
source={{ uri: 'asset:///sintel.mp4' }}
```

##### iPod Library (ipod-library://)

<PlatformsList types={['iOS']} />

Path to a sound file in your iTunes library. Typically shared from iTunes to your app.

Example:

```javascript
source={{ uri: 'ipod-library:///path/to/music.mp3' }}
```

Note: Using this feature adding an entry for NSAppleMusicUsageDescription to your Info.plist file as described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)

##### Explicit mimetype for the stream

Provide a member `type` with value (`mpd`/`m3u8`/`ism`) inside the source object.
Sometimes is needed when URL extension does not match with the mimetype that you are expecting, as seen on the next example. (Extension is .ism -smooth streaming- but file served is on format mpd -mpeg dash-)

Example:

```javascript
source={{ uri: 'http://host-serving-a-type-different-than-the-extension.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)',
type: 'mpd' }}
```

##### Other protocols

The following other types are supported on some platforms, but aren't fully documented yet:
`content://, ms-appx://, ms-appdata://, assets-library://`

#### Using DRM content

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

To setup DRM please follow [this guide](/component/drm)

Example:

```javascript
    {
      description: 'WV: Secure SD & HD (cbcs,MP4,H264)',
      uri: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/wvmedia/cbcs/h264/tears/tears_aes_cbcs.mpd',
      drm: {
        type: DRMType.WIDEVINE,
        licenseServer:
          'https://proxy.uat.widevine.com/proxy?provider=widevine_test',
      },
    },
```

> ⚠️ DRM is not supported on visionOS yet


#### Start playback at a specific point in time

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

Provide an optional `startPosition` for video. Value is in milliseconds. If the `cropStart` prop is applied, it will be applied from that point forward.
(If it is negative or undefined or null, it is ignored)

#### Playing only a portion of the video (start & end time)

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

Provide an optional `cropStart` and/or `cropEnd` for the video. Value is in milliseconds. Useful when you want to play only a portion of a large video.

Example

```javascript
source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropStart: 36012, cropEnd: 48500 }}

source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropStart: 36012 }}

source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropEnd: 48500 }}
```

#### Overriding the metadata of a source

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'tvOS']} />

Provide an optional `title`, `subtitle`, `artist`, `imageUri` and/or `description` properties for the video.
Useful when using notification controls on Android or iOS or to adapt the tvOS playback experience.

Example:

```javascript
source={{
    uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8',
    metadata: {
      title: 'Custom Title',
      subtitle: 'Custom Subtitle',
      artist: 'Custom Artist',
      description: 'Custom Description',
      imageUri: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498641868397191170/6qW2XkuI_400x400.png'
    }
  }}
```

#### `textTracksAllowChunklessPreparation`
<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

AllowChunklessPreparation for hls media source.
see: [disabling-chunkless](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer/hls?#disabling-chunkless) in android documentation.

Default value: true.

```javascript
source={{
    uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8',
    textTracksAllowChunklessPreparation: false,
  }}
```

### `subtitleStyle`

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Platforms    |

```

### `textTracks`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS', 'visionOS']} />

Load one or more "sidecar" text tracks. This takes an array of objects representing each track. Each object should have the format:

> ⚠️ This feature does not work with HLS playlists (e.g m3u8) on iOS

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title    | Descriptive name for the track                                                                                                                                                   |
| language | 2 letter [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) representing the language                                                                       |
| type     | Mime type of the track _ TextTrackType.SRT - SubRip (.srt) _ TextTrackType.TTML - TTML (.ttml) \* TextTrackType.VTT - WebVTT (.vtt)iOS only supports VTT, Android supports all 3 |
| uri      | URL for the text track. Currently, only tracks hosted on a webserver are supported                                                                                               |

On iOS, sidecar text tracks are only supported for individual files, not HLS playlists. For HLS, you should include the text tracks as part of the playlist.

Note: Due to iOS limitations, sidecar text tracks are not compatible with Airplay. If textTracks are specified, AirPlay support will be automatically disabled.

Example:

```javascript
import { TextTrackType }, Video from 'react-native-video';

textTracks={[
  {
    title: "English CC",
    language: "en",
    type: TextTrackType.VTT, // "text/vtt"
    uri: "https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/subtitles/subtitles_en.vtt"
  },
  {
    title: "Spanish Subtitles",
    language: "es",
    type: TextTrackType.SRT, // "application/x-subrip"
    uri: "https://durian.blender.org/wp-content/content/subtitles/sintel_es.srt"
  }
]}
```

### `showNotificationControls`

<PlatformsList types={['Android', 'iOS']} />

Controls whether to show media controls in the notification area.
For Android each Video component will have its own notification controls and for iOS only one notification control will be shown for the last Active Video component.

On android this will also allow for external controls, Google Assistant session and other benefits of MediaSession.

You propably want also set `playInBackground` to `true` to keep the video playing when the app is in the background or `playWhenInactive` to `true` to keep the video playing when notifications or the Control Center are in front of the video.

To customize the notification controls you can use `metadata` property in the `source` prop.

- **false (default)** - Don't show media controls in the notification area
- **true** - Show media controls in the notification area

**To test notification controls on iOS you need to run the app on a real device, as the simulator does not support it.**

**For Android you have to add the following code in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:**

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
    ...

    <application>
      ...
      <service
        android:name="com.brentvatne.exoplayer.VideoPlaybackService"
        android:exported="false"
        android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback">
          <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="androidx.media3.session.MediaSessionService" />
          </intent-filter>
      </service>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### `useSecureView`

> [!WARNING]
> deprecated, use viewType instead

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Force the output to a SurfaceView and enables the secure surface.

This will override useTextureView flag.

SurfaceView is is the only one that can be labeled as secure.

- **true** - Use security
- **false (default)** - Do not use security



### `useTextureView`

> [!WARNING]
> deprecated, use viewType instead

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Controls whether to output to a TextureView or SurfaceView.

SurfaceView is more efficient and provides better performance but has two limitations:

- It can't be animated, transformed or scaled
- You can't overlay multiple SurfaceViews

useTextureView can only be set at same time you're setting the source.

- **true (default)** - Use a TextureView
- **false** - Use a SurfaceView

### `viewType`

<PlatformsList types={['Android']} />

Allow to explicitly specify view type.
This flag replace `useSecureView` and `useTextureView` fields.
There are 3 available values:
- 'textureView': The video is rendered in a texture view. it allows mapping the view on a texture (useful for 3D).
DRM playback is not supported on textureView, if drm prop is provided, the suface will be transformed to a SurfaceView.
- 'surfaceView' (default): The video is rendered in a surface. take less resources to be rendered.
- 'secureView': The video is rendered in a surface which disallow taking screenshot of the video

### `volume`

<PlatformsList types={['All']} />

Adjust the volume.

- **1.0 (default)** - Play at full volume
- **0.0** - Mute the audio
- **Other values** - Reduce volume
