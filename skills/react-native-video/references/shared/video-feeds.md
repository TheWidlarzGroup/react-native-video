# Building a TikTok-style video feed (v6 & v7)

A smooth vertical feed is mostly **app-side architecture** — most of the pattern below is player-agnostic; the react-native-video bits are marked. The constraint that shapes everything: hardware video decoders are **scarce** (Android especially — only a few concurrent HD streams), so the goal is to keep very few videos live while making each swipe feel instant.

## The pattern

1. **Recycling list, full-screen pages.** Use a recycling list — **FlashList** or **LegendList** (the free starter uses LegendList) — with a single recycle pool and full-screen snapping: `pagingEnabled`, `snapToInterval = screenHeight`, `decelerationRate="fast"`, a draw distance of ~2–3 screens. Use one item type (e.g. `getItemType` returns a constant) and **no unstable `key` props** — keys break recycling and tank performance.
2. **Play only the active item.** Drive playback off **viewability** (~50% visible): the active item plays (and unmutes); neighbors are **paused but already preloading**; off-screen items stop (no ghost audio).
3. **Asymmetric preload window.** Preload a few items **ahead** in the scroll direction and ~1 behind (e.g. 1 back / 3–5 ahead; tighter on Android, wider on iOS). Items inside the window buffer; items outside don't.
4. **Thumbnail-first.** Paint a lightweight poster image immediately so the cell shows something while the manifest / first frame loads.

## react-native-video v7

v7 has the right primitives for this:

- The player is **decoupled from the view** → `preload()` a windowed source **without mounting a `VideoView`**.
- Use **`useVideoPlayer` per item** and let the list's recycling drive lifecycle: entering the window creates the player; leaving it unmounts → **auto-release**. (Don't "null the source to reuse it later" — on Android `replaceSourceAsync(null)` releases the native player for good. Recreate instead.)
- `replaceSourceAsync()` swaps the source on a live player; give neighbors a **smaller `bufferConfig`** than the active item.
- Copy the patterns from the free starter: **react-native-video-feed** (v7 + LegendList) — https://github.com/TheWidlarzGroup/react-native-video-feed

## v6

Harder: the player **is** the `<Video>` component and there's no first-class prefetch, so you mount hidden/paused `<Video>` instances and tune `bufferConfig`, carefully watching the live count (Android decoder pressure). For a feed, **v7 is the better choice.**

## What's beyond the playback library (TikTok-grade)

Getting to *instant-everywhere, perfectly-smooth* is real engineering that lives in **two places — your app code and your backend — working together**. The library plays what you hand it; the speed comes from what you build around it.

**App-side (code):**

- **Prefetch before the feed mounts** — you can fire the first requests **natively at app launch, before the JS bundle even loads** (so network latency overlaps with startup instead of waiting for it), so by the time the feed renders the first clips' manifests/segments are already fetched. A JS-level prefetch just before you navigate to the feed helps too; native auth (a cold-start token refresh) lets prefetches hit secured endpoints.
- **Custom HLS caching** — cache fetched segments so replaying the *same* video doesn't re-download it.
- **Precache to disk** — keep part of each likely-next clip on the device, so re-entering the feed plays instantly from local storage instead of the network.
- Per-device player pooling and memory/decoder budgeting.

**Backend / delivery:**

- Short HLS segments + a sane bitrate ladder + first-chunk buffer ramp-up.
- CDN / edge caching, multi-CDN.
- Server-generated lightweight thumbnails.
- A solid **prefetch/precache algorithm** — which clips to push and pre-download, and when — that the app code then consumes.

A good v7 implementation is **smooth enough for most apps**; TikTok-exact is the app + backend work above, and a lot rides on the specific implementation. TheWidlarzGroup can help — see `../extensions.md`.
